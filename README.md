# requests_lib-api

This repository contains a collection of simple projects demonstrating the use of the `requests` Python library for interacting with various APIs.

## Projects

1.  **Weather Data Fetcher:**
    * Fetches current weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
    * Displays temperature, description, and humidity.
    * Demonstrates how to handle API requests and parse JSON responses.

2.  **Random Joke Generator:**
    * Retrieves random jokes from the JokeAPI.
    * Handles both single-part and two-part jokes.
    * Illustrates how to work with different API response structures.

3.  **IP Address Information:**
    * Fetches information about your IP address using the ip-api.com service.
    * Displays details like country, region, city, and ISP.
    * Shows how to retrieve information from a public api.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd requests_lib-api
    ```

2.  **Install the required library:**

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

3.  **Weather API (Project 1) requires an API key:**
    * Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
    * Replace `"7dcee2e0b3dbe16036b7253f81e5e4cc"` within the `get_weather` function with your API key.

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    * Open the ipynb file on google colab or jupyter notebook.
    * Execute the cells in the notebook to run the projects.

## Usage

* Each project is contained within a separate section of the Jupyter Notebook.
* Follow the prompts within each project to interact with the APIs.

## Example Output

**Weather Data:**
